On my free time when not spending time with my daughter, I love playing Call of Duty and various other games. I was motivated to build a platform where gamers from all around the world can come together and share their experiences. A main goal for me and my team was to add user interactivity to this site as opposed to just being able to search information. We had a blast creating it, and we hope you enjoy!"</p>

Now, after a year of classes, I am able to put together a functioning website. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing video games or at the gym. Our team has come together collectively to create a game FAQ app because we all share a common interest in gaming. Being able to put this project together with a passionate team has been an amazing experience. I hope you enjoy our site as much as we do!"</p>
